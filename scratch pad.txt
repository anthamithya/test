Hello, i have couple of questions regarding your earlier message, welcome letter service will fetch the message from the SQS, talks to EIS, and then talks to CCM api using that response. 
SQS -> Welcome Service -> EIS -> CCM
Is my understanding correct?
If so, whats the reference message structure of SQS message?
What is the mapping between SQS message and EIS? And also, what is the mapping with EIS to CCM API.
In the CCM Swagger docs, multiple examples of payload was shown, can you please let me know when to use each.
Thanks
